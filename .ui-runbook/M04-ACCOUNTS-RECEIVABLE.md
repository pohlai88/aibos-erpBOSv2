- Click to drill into any aging bucket
- Real-time updates as payments post
- Better than Zoho/QuickBooks static reports
- Export drill-down details instantly

**Implementation**:

```typescript
import { Chart, Popover } from "aibos-ui";

<AgingChart
  data={agingData}
  interactive
  onClick={(bucket) => showInvoices(bucket)}
  visualization="treemap"
  colors={agingColors}
/>;
```

### 3. **Automated Collections Workflow** ü§ñ

**Description**: Intelligent collections management with automated email reminders and escalation rules.

**Why It's Killer**:

- Reduces DSO by 30%

**Implementation**:

```typescript
import { Timeline, Card, Button } from "aibos-ui";

<CollectionsWorkbench
  customer={customer}
  overdue={overdueInvoices}
  actions={{
    sendReminder: true,
    scheduleCall: true,
    escalate: true,
  }}
  automation={{
    reminderDays: [7, 14, 30],
    escalationThreshold: 60,
  }}
/>;
```

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RBAC Scopes     | `ar.read`, `ar.write`, `ar.post`, `ar.collections`, `ar.admin`          |
| Enforcement     | Server-side on all endpoints                                            |
| Client Behavior | Hide post/write-off actions based on permissions                        |

- Collections workbench only visible to `ar.collections` and `ar.admin` roles
- Display permission-denied state if user navigates directly to restricted URL

### Reliability & Observability

- **SLO**: 99.9% successful responses on AR endpoints
- **SLA Dashboards**: Real-time metrics on payment posting success rate, aging calculation time
- **Events Emitted**: `AR.Invoice.Created/Posted/Paid/WrittenOff`, `AR.Payment.Applied/Reversed`, `AR.Collections.ReminderSent`
- **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs for all mutations
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across BFF ‚Üí Kernel ‚Üí Payment Gateway

## üß¨ Data & Domain Invariants

### AR Business Rules

| Rule                    | Enforcement                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Invoice Posting**     | Cannot post invoice with $0 amount or without line items     |
| **Payment Application** | Payment amount cannot exceed invoice balance                 |
| **Credit Limit**        | Enforce customer credit limit before posting new invoices    |
| **Aging Buckets**       | Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days based on due date      |
| **Write-Off Threshold** | Requires approval for write-offs > $1,000                    |
| **Multi-Currency**      | Invoice and payment must be in same currency or auto-convert |
| **Revenue Recognition** | Link to revenue schedule for accrual-based accounting        |

### Currency & Rounding

- **Display**: Customer's currency preference or presentation currency
- **Rounding Policy**: HALF_UP to 2 decimal places (currency standard)
- **Multi-Currency**: Support FX conversion at payment application time
- **FX Gains/Losses**: Auto-post to designated GL accounts

### Archive/Write-Off Semantics

- **Draft Invoices**: Can be deleted permanently
- **Posted Invoices**: Cannot be deleted; must be written off or reversed
- **Payments**: Can be reversed (creates negative payment entry)
- **Write-Offs**: Require reason code and approval for amounts > $1,000
- **Guard Rails**:
  - ‚ùå Deny delete if invoice is posted
  - ‚ùå Deny payment application if customer over credit limit
  - ‚úÖ Allow credit memos to reduce invoice balance

## üóÇÔ∏è State, Caching, and Invalidation

### React Query Keys

```typescript
// Query key structure
["ar", "invoices", { filters }][("ar", "invoice", invoiceId)][
  ("ar", "aging", asOfDate)
][("ar", "collections", { filters })][("ar", "payments", { filters })][
  ("ar", "statements", customerId, dateRange)
];
```

### Invalidation Rules

| Action         | Invalidates                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create Invoice | `["ar", "invoices"]`, `["ar", "aging"]`                       |
| Post Invoice   | `["ar"]` (all AR data), `["journals"]`, `["trial-balance"]`   |
| Apply Payment  | `["ar", "invoices"]`, `["ar", "aging"]`, `["ar", "payments"]` |
| Write Off      | `["ar", "invoices"]`, `["ar", "aging"]`                       |
| Send Reminder  | `["ar", "collections"]`                                       |

### Stale Time

| Query Type     | Stale Time | Reasoning                                  |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Invoice List   | 30s        | Frequent updates; real-time visibility     |
| Invoice Detail | 1min       | Less frequently changed                    |
| Aging Report   | 5min       | Aggregated data; recalculated periodically |
| Collections    | 1min       | Status changes frequently                  |

### Cache Tags (Next.js)

```typescript
// Server actions
revalidateTag("ar"); // After mutations
revalidateTag(`ar-invoice-${invoiceId}`); // Specific invoice
revalidateTag("aging"); // After posting/payment
```

## üß™ Test Data & Fixtures

### Storybook Fixtures

**Location**: `apps/web/fixtures/ar.fixtures.ts`

**Datasets**:

- `minimalInvoices`: 5 invoices (various statuses)
- `standardInvoices`: 50 invoices across aging buckets
- `largeDataset`: 1,000 invoices (for performance testing)
- `edgeCases`: Special scenarios (overpayments, multi-currency, credit limits)

**Edge Cases Covered**:

- Invoices in all aging buckets (Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+)
- Multi-currency invoices (USD, EUR, GBP)
- Partially paid invoices
- Overpayments requiring refund
- Credit limit scenarios
- Write-off approval workflows

```typescript
// Example fixture structure
export const standardInvoices: ARInvoiceFixture[] = [
  {
    id: "inv_1",
    invoice_number: "INV-2025-001",
    customer_id: "cust_1",
    customer_name: "Acme Corp",
    invoice_date: "2025-01-01",
    due_date: "2025-01-31",
    amount: 5000.0,
    balance: 5000.0,
    status: "posted",
    currency: "USD",
    aging_bucket: "current",
  },
  // ... 49 more
];
```

### E2E Seed Data

**Location**: `tests/seeds/ar.seed.ts`

**Seed Command**:

```powershell
pnpm run seed:ar
```

**Dataset**:

- 100 invoices across 20 customers
- Various aging buckets and payment statuses
- 30 payments applied to invoices
- 10 collection activities
- Multi-currency scenarios (30% of invoices)

**Cleanup Command**:

```powershell
pnpm run seed:ar:clean
```

### Demo Dataset (Staging/Sandbox)

**Purpose**: Customer demos, UAT, training

**Characteristics**:

- Realistic customer portfolio: "Demo Customer A-Z"
- 150 invoices with realistic aging distribution
- Payment history for 60% of invoices
- Collection activities demonstrating workflow
- Multi-currency examples (USD, EUR, GBP)

**Regeneration**:

```powershell
pnpm run demo:reset:ar
```

### Test Data Validation

**Automated Checks** (run in CI):

- [ ] All fixtures pass Zod schema validation
- [ ] No orphaned customer references
- [ ] Payment amounts don't exceed invoice balances
- [ ] Aging buckets calculated correctly
- [ ] Credit limits enforced in test scenarios

---

## üîó API Contract Sync (CI Enforcement)

### Prevent Drift

**CI Step**: Fail build if `packages/contracts/openapi/openapi.json` changes without regenerating `types.gen.ts`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check API types sync
  run: |
    pnpm run generate:api-types
    git diff --exit-code packages/api-client/src/types.gen.ts
```

### Hook Layer Contract

- **Rule**: Hooks **only** use generated types from `@aibos/api-client`
- **No ad-hoc shapes**: All API calls must match OpenAPI spec
- **Validation**: TypeScript enforces at compile time

---

## üñ•Ô∏è RSC/SSR & App Router Compatibility

### Server/Client Boundaries

- **Pages**: Server components by default
- **Interactive Parts**: Mark with `"use client"` (invoice forms, payment modals, collections interface)

### Data Fetching Strategy

| Scenario            | Strategy                                   | Benefit              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Invoice List        | Server-side fetch + stream                 | Faster TTFB          |
| Mutations           | Client-side React Query                    | Optimistic updates   |
| Aging Report        | Server component with client interactivity | SEO + drill-downs    |
| Payment Application | Client-side form + API                     | Real-time validation |

### Cache Strategy

```typescript
// Server actions
"use server";

import { revalidateTag } from "next/cache";

export async function postInvoice(id: string) {
  // ... mutation logic
  revalidateTag("ar");
  revalidateTag("journals");
  revalidateTag("trial-balance");
}
```

| AR.Aging.Viewed             | Report accessed    | `as_of_date`, `filters`, `export_format?`         |

**Implementation**:

```typescript
import { analytics } from "@/lib/analytics";

analytics.track("AR.Invoice.Posted", {
  invoice_id: invoice.id,
  customer_id: invoice.customer_id,
  amount: invoice.amount,
  currency: invoice.currency,
  gl_entry_id: glEntry.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

## üåê i18n/L10n & Keyboard Shortcuts

### Internationalization

- **i18n Keys**: All labels, errors, toasts from `@/i18n/messages/ar.json`
- **Date/Number Formatting**: Use `Intl` APIs with tenant locale
- **RTL Support**: CSS logical properties; test with Arabic
- **Currency Formatting**: Respect locale currency display conventions

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key      | Action                | Scope          |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| `/`      | Focus search          | Invoice list   |
| `n`      | New invoice           | Invoice list   |
| `p`      | Post selected invoice | Invoice detail |
| `a`      | Apply payment         | Invoice detail |
| `Enter`  | Open selected invoice | Table          |
| `Escape` | Close modal/cancel    | Modal/Form     |

**Implementation**:

```typescript
useHotkeys([
  ["/", () => searchInputRef.current?.focus()],
  ["n", () => openCreateModal()],
  ["p", () => postInvoice(selectedId)],
  ["a", () => openPaymentModal()],
]);
```

| Production  | All users (100%) | Monitor for 24h, error budget maintained | Ongoing  | Error rate spike |

### Feature Flag Configuration

```typescript
// Feature flags for gradual rollout
flags: {
  m4_ar: false,                  // Master toggle
  m4_ar_auto_match: false,       // AI payment matching
  m4_ar_collections: false,      // Collections automation
}
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

**Key Metrics** (real-time):

- Error rate by page (`/ar`, `/ar/invoices/[id]`, `/ar/aging`)
- P50/P95/P99 latency
- Payment matching accuracy
- Collections email delivery rate
- Feature flag adoption rate

**Alert Thresholds**:

- Error rate > 1% for 5min ‚Üí page to on-call
- P95 latency > 500ms for 10min ‚Üí investigate
- Payment matching accuracy < 90% ‚Üí alert AI team

### UI Rollback Procedure

**Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes):

1. **Set feature flag**: `flags.m4_ar = false`

   ```powershell
   pnpm run flags:set m4_ar=false
   ```

2. **Invalidate cache**:

   ```typescript
   revalidateTag("ar");
   revalidateTag("aging");
   ```

3. **Clear CDN cache**:

   ```powershell
   pnpm run cache:purge --path="/ar/*"
   ```

4. **Monitor for 15 minutes**:

   - Error rate drops below 0.1%
   - No new Sentry issues

5. **Post-mortem**:
   - Create incident report
   - Add regression test

**Rollback Decision Matrix**:

| Scenario               | Action             | Approval Required |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Error rate > 5%        | Immediate rollback | No (auto-trigger) |
| Error rate 1-5%        | Partial rollback   | On-call engineer  |
| P95 latency > 1s       | Investigate first  | On-call engineer  |
| Data corruption/loss   | Immediate rollback | No (auto-trigger) |
| Payment mismatch spike | Disable auto-match | AI team + PM      |
