# Error Handling and HITL Debugging Rules

## Error Resolution Standards

### No Compromise Policy

- **NEVER** compromise on error resolution or make assumptions
- **NEVER** proceed with broken or failing code
- **NEVER** ignore errors or warnings
- **NEVER** provide workarounds that mask underlying issues

### Error Analysis Requirements

- **ANALYZE** all errors thoroughly before attempting resolution
- **IDENTIFY** root causes, not just symptoms
- **DOCUMENT** error context, environment, and reproduction steps
- **VALIDATE** understanding of the error before proposing solutions

### HITL Debugging Protocol

When encountering errors that cannot be resolved:

1. **STOP** - Immediately halt current operations
2. **SUMMARIZE** - Provide comprehensive error summary including:
   - Error messages and stack traces
   - Environment details (OS, Node version, package versions)
   - Steps that led to the error
   - Current system state
3. **REQUEST** - Ask for Human-in-the-Loop debugging assistance
4. **WAIT** - Do not proceed until human guidance is provided

### Error Summary Format

```
## Error Summary for HITL Debugging

### Error Details
- **Type**: [Error type/category]
- **Message**: [Exact error message]
- **Stack Trace**: [Full stack trace if available]

### Environment Context
- **OS**: [Operating system and version]
- **Node.js**: [Version]
- **Package Manager**: [pnpm/npm version]
- **Project State**: [Current working directory, git status]

### Reproduction Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Attempted Solutions
- [List any attempted fixes]
- [Why they failed]

### Request for Human Assistance
[Specific question or guidance needed]
```

### Prohibited Actions

- **DO NOT** make educated guesses about error causes
- **DO NOT** try random solutions without understanding
- **DO NOT** modify code without clear understanding of the issue
- **DO NOT** proceed with partial fixes
- **DO NOT** ignore error messages or warnings

### Required Actions

- **DO** provide complete error context
- **DO** ask specific questions for guidance
- **DO** wait for human input before proceeding
- **DO** maintain system integrity during debugging
- **DO** document all debugging attempts

## File Types This Rule Applies To

- All files and operations
- Terminal commands and scripts
- Package installations and configurations
- Git operations and version control
- Build and deployment processes

## Enforcement Actions

1. **STOP** - Immediately halt on unresolved errors
2. **SUMMARIZE** - Provide comprehensive error analysis
3. **REQUEST** - Ask for HITL debugging assistance
4. **WAIT** - Do not proceed without human guidance
